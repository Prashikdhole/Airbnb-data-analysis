Airbnb,as in "Air Bed and Breakfast",is an online market that lets property owners rent out their spaces to travellers looking for accommodation. Travellers can rent a space for multiple people to share, a shared space with private rooms,or the entire property for themselves. NYC is the most populous city in the United States, and one of the most popular tourism and business places globally.
